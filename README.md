## üåü What's Next  

### Backend Development Recommendations  
- **Framework**: Use **Node.js** with **Express.js** or **NestJS** for structured and scalable backend development.  
- **Database**: Switch to **PostgreSQL** for better relational database management.  
- **ORM**: Utilize **Prisma** or **TypeORM** to simplify database operations.  
- **Authentication**: Implement **JWT** for secure token-based authentication.  
- **File Uploads**: Use **Multer** for handling file uploads.  
- **Caching**: Integrate **Redis** for caching to optimize performance.  
- **File Storage**: Utilize **AWS S3** or **Google Cloud Storage** for storing uploaded files.  

### Additional Features to Implement  
1. **Pagination & Filtering**: Efficiently display and filter large datasets.  
2. **Data Export**: Allow exporting data in PDF or Excel formats.  
3. **Image Optimization**: Improve loading speed by optimizing images.  
4. **File Storage Integration**: Enhance file management capabilities with external storage.  
5. **Caching**: Boost application performance by caching frequently accessed data.  
6. **Logging**: Track application behavior and errors with detailed logs.  

### Suggested Backend Structure  
- **Routes**: Organize routes for API endpoints (e.g., `/residents`, `/issues`, `/tasks`).  
- **Controllers**: Handle business logic for each feature.  
- **Models**: Define database schemas and relationships using an ORM like Prisma or TypeORM.  
- **Services**: Implement reusable logic for controllers.  
- **Middleware**: Add authentication, validation, and logging middleware.  
- **Utilities**: Include helper functions for pagination, caching, and file handling.
